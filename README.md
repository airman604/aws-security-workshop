# AWS Security 101 Workshop

Welcome to the AWS Security 101 workshop.

## Pre-requisites

You will use your own AWS account to provision the lab environment. We provide
the provisioning and de-provisioning scripts to make the process easier, and
to ensure all the resources are deleted once you complete the workship to
minimize any costs. **PLEASE NOTE, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AWS CHARGES RELATED
TO YOUR USE OF THE GUIDES AND SCRIPTS IN THIS REPOSITORY.** Having said that, such
charges should be minimal.

### Deployment

To participate in the labs, you need to deploy the lab environment to your AWS account
before the workshop!

1. Create an AWS account, if you don't have one:
    - Go to <https://aws.amazon.com/>, click **Create an AWS Account** and follow the instructions.
    - You will need a credit card.
2. Login into your AWS account, then in the top right corner switch to `us-west-2` region
   (**US West (Oregon)**) and open **Cloud Shell**.
3. Clone this repository and run `deploy.sh`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/airman604/aws-security-workshop.git
cd aws-security-workshop
./deploy.sh
```

Deployment takes around 5 minutes. Once the deployment is complete take a note of the displayed frontend URL.

### Cleanup

1. Run `./destroy.sh` in the **Cloud Shell** (from the cloned repository folder).
2. Delete any resources that you created manually during the labs:
    - delete WAF configuration
    - delete S3 bucket that was created for ALB logs
    - disable **GuardDuty**
    - delete the **CloudTrail** trail
